# notice :
    In this project I use pusher to manage the sending messages
    in the .env file I sent my pusher channel to make it easy to use application for you
    might be you would like to use your own pusher channel so you must register at pusher.com and make your own channel and then
    update .env file with your pusher channel.


Although by follow this structure application will run, I will be on call to help you to run the app if you face any problem.

thanks
